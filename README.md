Overview
The Traffic Challan Management System is a Python-based application that uses the Tkinter library for GUI. It streamlines the process of managing traffic violations, vehicle information, and fines. It provides a dashboard for both police officers and drivers to interact with the system for issuing and reviewing challans (traffic fines).

Features
Police Dashboard:
  *Search for vehicle information using a vehicle number.
  *View detailed information about fines and offenses for a vehicle.
  *Add fines for specific offenses.
  *Generate and print a detailed receipt of fines for a vehicle.

Driver Dashboard:
  *View vehicle details, including fines and offense history.
Authentication:

Police login with username and password (validated from police_credentials.csv).
Driver login with a vehicle number.

Database Management:
  *Maintains vehicle information, offenses, and fines in a CSV file (database.csv).
  *Adds new vehicle details if they donâ€™t exist in the database.
Offenses Tracking:
  *Tracks specific offenses such as speeding, reckless driving, parking violations, and more.

How to Use-

Police Login
  Use the Police Login button on the main screen.
  Enter the police credentials (username and password).
  Access the dashboard to:
  Search vehicle details.

  Print challan receipts.
Driver Login

File Structure

  *traffic_challan_system.py: Main script for the application.
*police_credentials.csv: Stores police usernames and passwords.
*database.csv: Stores vehicle and offense data.

Known Issues and Limitations
  *Does not currently support online or networked databases.
  *Basic security: Passwords are stored in plain text in the police_credentials.csv file.
  *Fine amounts are manually entered without pre-defined ranges or limits.
Future Enhancements
  *Integrate with a proper database (e.g., MySQL, SQLite).
  *Add password encryption for police credentials.
  *Implement additional offense types or custom fine categories.
  *Include analytics for viewing trends in traffic violations.
  *Add localization for multi-language support.
